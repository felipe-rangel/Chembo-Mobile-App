# Chembo-Mobile-App
In the main folder are screenshots and recordings of the Chembo App on MIT App Inventor and the .aia file of the project that can be imported into MIT App Inventor. 
The screenshots include the block code of the screens and the main interface. 
Gameplay:
  The player enters the main game screen with the goal to get to the bottom right of the grid
  bonding the elements/ions along the way. You start the game with 2 hearts for 3x3 grid, 3 for 4x4, and 4 for 5x5.
  The grid is randomly generated every single time the RESET button is clicked or when the game screen
  is intialized.
  The two buttons CHECK and IDK are used to either verify your answer or ask for the answer.
    Though if you ask for the answer your multiplier for the highscore will go back to zero and you lose a heart!
    You reach zero hearts and the games ends.
    But the highscore is saved on the device for future games.
The recordings include three configurations of the game in its easy, medium, and hard difficulty modes.
  Easy just contains the common cations/anions elements. 
  Medium is all the Easy cation/anions + polyatomic ions.
  Hard is Medium + common metallic ions.
